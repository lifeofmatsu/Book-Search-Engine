## Overview

Weather Dashboard is a dynamic web application that provides users with real-time weather data, including forecasts, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, this application delivers accurate and up-to-date weather information for cities around the globe.

## Features

- **Current Weather Data:** Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more for the selected city.
- **Five-Day Forecast:** Offers an extended forecast showing upcoming weather conditions.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for cities worldwide and view their current and future weather conditions.
- **Search History:** Keeps a record of recent searches for quick access to previously viewed cities.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

**Example: Searching for Tokyo, Japan in Light Mode:**

**Example: Searching for Tokyo, Japan in Dark Mode:**

**Example: Searching by City Name and using string-matching autocompletion:**

**Example: Searching by Zip Code:**

_Note that autocompletion does not function for Zip Code queries._

## Unresolved Issues

- Autocomplete suggestions tend to include locations that do not match the search string (e.g., Typing in `New York` also returned `Lake Oswego, Oregon, US`). Additionally, autocomplete may not match cities to the search string until the user fully types out the city name.

- Issues with OpenWeather API unpredictably returning temperatures in Kelvin or Celsius, rather than Fahrenheit, which may sabotage the temperature conversion function in `helpers.js`.

- Toggling between Dark Mode and Light Mode displaces the positioning of the header, causing gaps on the edges of the screen.
